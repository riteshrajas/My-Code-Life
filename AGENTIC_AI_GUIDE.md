# 🤖 Agentic Athera Advisor - User Guide

The Athera Advisor has been upgraded with **Agentic AI capabilities**! It can now not only provide life guidance but also take actions within your My Life Code app.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Enable Agentic Mode**: Toggle the "Agentic Mode" switch in the advisor panel
2. **Request Actions**: Use natural language to request actions
3. **Get Things Done**: The AI will execute actions automatically or ask for confirmation

- **Update Tasks**: "Mark task #123 as completed"
- **Delete Tasks**: "Delete the grocery shopping task"

## 💬 Example Conversations

### Creating a Task
**You**: "I need to prepare for my presentation next Friday"
**AI**: "I'll create that task for you! Creating a task to prepare for your presentation with a due date of next Friday."
**Result**: ✅ Task "Prepare for presentation" created successfully

### Changing Theme
**You**: "The app is too bright, make it darker"
**AI**: "I'll switch the app to dark mode for you!"
**Result**: ✅ Theme changed to dark mode successfully

### Creating a Habit
**You**: "I want to build a daily meditation habit"
**AI**: "I'll set up a daily meditation habit for you!"
**Result**: ✅ Habit "Daily Meditation" created successfully

## 🔒 Safety Features

- **Confirmation Required**: Dangerous actions (like deleting data) require explicit confirmation
- **Error Handling**: If an action fails, you'll get clear error messages
- **Fallback Mode**: If agentic mode has issues, it automatically falls back to advice-only mode

## 🎯 Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "Create a task to buy groceries tomorrow at 3 PM" works better than "remind me about groceries"
2. **Natural Language**: You don't need exact commands - speak naturally!
3. **Context Matters**: The AI remembers your conversation context for better assistance
4. **Toggle Modes**: Switch between agentic and advice-only modes based on your needs

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Action Failed?**
- Check if you have the necessary permissions
- Try rephrasing your request
- Toggle agentic mode off and on again

**AI Not Understanding?**
- Be more specific about what you want
- Use action keywords like "create", "update", "change", "delete"
- Check if the action is supported (see list above)

## 🎨 Advanced Usage

### Batch Operations
"Create three tasks: call mom, buy groceries, and finish the report - all due tomorrow"

### Conditional Actions
"If it's after 5 PM, create a task to review today's work"

### Profile Updates
"Update my profile: I'm a senior developer at TechCorp, interested in AI and machine learning"
